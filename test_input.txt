Country will achieve growth targets, says Premier Li

China is set to achieve its annual economic growth targets despite the weak global economy, Premier Li Keqiang said at a news conference on Wednesday.

The country also has policy tools in place to anchor the economy if "it slides below the appropriate range", he said after the closing meeting of the fourth session of the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing.

The Chinese economy is facing the challenge of restructuring and while performances have varied across different regions and industries, the economy as a whole "has great potential," he said. "We have full confidence in the long-term growth prospects of the Chinese economy."

The country will promote market competition and encourage innovation to unleash the economy's potential, Li said.
